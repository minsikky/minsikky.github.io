 <!-- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLK3pGELbSs">*This is an exciting time to be a graduate student, donâ€™t you think?*</a> -->

I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://vlsisp.engin.umich.edu">VLSI-SP Group</a> of University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by Professor Zhengya Zhang. My research interests include domain-specific architecture, reconfigurable computing, and hardware design frameworks. Check out my [Curriculum Vitae](../CV_221211.pdf) for more information.

Before joining University of Michigan, I got my B.S. at Seoul National University in 2023.

<!-- During 2022-2023, I worked with Professor Jae-Joon Kim at <a href="https://vlsi.snu.ac.kr">SNU VLSI Lab</a>, as an undergraduate research intern. under the guidance of Professor Jae-Joon Kim. -->
