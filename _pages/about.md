 <!-- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLK3pGELbSs">*This is an exciting time to be a graduate student, donâ€™t you think?*</a> -->

I am a senior undergraduate student at Seoul National University, expected to graduate in a couple of months. My research interests include domain-specific architecture, reconfigurable computing, and agile hardware design frameworks. Check out my [Curriculum Vitae](../CV_221206.pdf) for more information.

I am currently working as a research intern at <a href="https://vlsi.snu.ac.kr">SNU VLSI Lab</a>, under the guidance of Professor Jae-Joon Kim.
